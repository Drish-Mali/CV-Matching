      "summary": "Developed conceptual plans for two intersections near Jersey Shore University Medical Center, based on traffic data, geometric constraints, and roadway design standards. Employed knowledge of Microstation, Inroads, Excel, and VBA to efficiently complete miscellaneous tasks, including producing reports, creating visual displays, and generating automated text descriptions. Applied vehicle turning software (AutoTurn) to analyze intersection design and geometric layout on various projects. Member of the highway design team on I-295 Direct Connection Contract 3 project; developed grading on complex pavement widening sections, revised vertical and horizontal alignments to meet NJDOT standards, modeled highway sections using CAD (Microstation) and design software (Inroads), and generated plan cross sections. Coordinated quantity effort across multiple disciplines (Highway, Electrical, Drainage, Utilities) on I-295 Direct Connection Contract 3; used in-house Excel VBA program to collect and organize quantity data, and devised additional VBA macros to optimize the initial setup and printing of quantity calculation sheets. Designed horizontal and vertical alignments, superelevation constraints, and guide rail for I-280 Ramp 2P bridge deck replacement project. Worked on multiple roadway resurfacing and maintenance projects; identified critical as-built information to present on plans, and developed ADA compliant grading and geometric layout for pedestrian facilities."

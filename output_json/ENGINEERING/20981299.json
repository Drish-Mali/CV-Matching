Developed control plans and schedules to support prototype development, pre production and zero defect production parts launch. Studied market forecast, conducted benchmarking and manufacturing cost analysis for new product introduction. Lead APQP, DVP&R and PPAP development and conducted DFMEA for new product development. Scheduled and coordinated phases of project (cost, tooling, equipment,) to develop 'World class model line manufacturing' implementing (TPS). Successfully launched new product assembly project worth $100 million adhering to Toyota standards. Performed design reviews, documented BOM and created assembly process documentations. Reduced manufacturing costs by 30% by improving SQD (Safety, Quality & Delivery) KPI's metrics. Performed and ensured quality and reliability of processes and developed validation recovery plans. Spearheaded cost estimations and closure of non-conformance reports using quality tools (Pareto charts, Fishbone analysis, 8D, 5Why, FMEA). Developed actions for IPQPR's (In process quality problem reports), SQPR's (Supplier quality problem reports) to present to Japanese quality teams. Prepared product and process engineering change requests (ECR's) documentations, cost reduction proposals and presented to management. Developed manufacturing process layout, control plans, work instructions and PFMEA.",
